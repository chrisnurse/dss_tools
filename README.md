Documentation is a work in progress, however, please refer to each shell script as they are all commented.

To get started, in BASH shell:

Make a local copy of these scripts where you may want to edit them.
Edit the go_astro.sh and set the "home" location for your astronomical images.

In order to initialise your shell ready for data management, execute:
    . go_astro.sh

All this does is to change to your home location, and setup environment variables.

Then execute:

    astro_help.sh

You will see a brief explanation of each command.
